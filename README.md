## X-Line Stopwatch QT

The general idea is that you can shut it down and or restart the computer and when you load it up again it will remember where you left off.
File >> New to add a new timer.
Its possible to have several timers (e.g. one per client) which can be stopped or started by double clicking on them.
All timers are saved to an xml file which can be modified by hand if needed.
You can export daily totals to a spreadsheet
The file 'Timers v.1.xml' can be deleted or archived if needed. The application will recreate it if not found.

This is a QT version port of the original project. The version of QT we are using is PySide2.
